# 373-Group-13-Project
Way I used to get the project to my pc

1)download git desktop  <br />
2)clone this project to local folder on pc  <br />
3)open project with eclipse and edit <br />
4)push and pull via git desktop  <br />
 <br />
 you can also use the git extention in eclipse, it was just giving me authentication errors that I couldnt fix <br />
 you could also do it all through your terminal, but it takes knowning the commands
